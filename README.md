###### F#*k!ng Source Maps
```
Generating source maps, which actually work and point to the correct file is a real pain. There is a known bug in sass, which will mess up the paths. It took me literally hours to find out how to use gulp-ruby-sass and gulp-sourcemaps in combination to get working source maps.
